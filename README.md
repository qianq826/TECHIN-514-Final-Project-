Description:
This system is designed to improve basketball shooting techniques by providing real-time feedback on arm movement. It consists of a sensor device worn on the arm to track motion and a separate display device that shows feedback. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze shooting form and offers personalized tips for improvement.

Sketch Overview:
The sensor device is a sleek, arm-worn band with embedded sensors.
The display device is a compact screen, either wrist-mounted or stand-alone.
Both devices have a modern, sporty design highlighting their functionality.
